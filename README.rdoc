== Reservester

@Startup Institute (http://www.startupinstitute.com/) Summer 2013 I built a mock of open table called Reservester to gain better familiarity with ruby and the rails frame work. Guidelines were provided for the project but the implementation was open ended. 

The app is still a work in progress with various features and Todos kept on an independent list.
